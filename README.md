# [Red-Teaming-Challenge---OpenAI-gpt-oss-20b](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/openai-gpt-oss-20b-red-teaming/data)
Find any flaws and vulnerabilities in gpt-oss-20b that have not been previously discovered or reports.

# ðŸ”´ Red Teaming Hackathon â€“ Prompt Injection & Bias in Resume Screening

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

We explore vulnerabilities in LLM-powered systems:
1. **Prompt Injection Attack** â€“ bypassing safety filters.
2. **Bias in Resume Screening** â€“ unfair outputs based on gender.
3. Propose **Multi-Agent Defense Framework** to mitigate risks.
